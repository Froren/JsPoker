# JS Poker Live

A fork of the [mdp/JsPoker](https://github.com/mdp/JsPoker) project that crudely hacks together an interactive version of the game.

## Installation

    git clone
    npm install
    node play/npm start
  *navigate to localhost:3000*

Hopefully the game is self-explanatory from that point.

## What is this project?

I've made sweeping changes throughout the different modules to achieve this goal, so I've compiled **JSPoker** into a single repository made my changes on top of it.

You can look at the history to get an idea of what I did, feel free to fork/improve/experiment with it.

## Projects Used

[JSPoker](https://github.com/mdp/JsPoker), and related projects (MachinePoker, Binions, Hoyle)

[Poker.JS](https://github.com/Tairraos/Poker.JS) for displaying cards as images
